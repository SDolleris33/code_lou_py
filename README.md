----ABOUT---- 
This repo includes the entirety of my PYTHON project. The project is a comprehensive inventory program; that allows input through various phases contained within a Master Loop. The loop is based on conditional 'if' statements that are passed by string values. Explicitly follow steps: 

"Dose up on Games"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1.)  type 'games'
        -View our Games (Type games)                                                                                                                                                                        2.)  type 'add'
        -Add to Cart (Type add)                                                                                                                                                                              3.)  type 'buy'
        -Checkout (Type buy)                                                                                                                                                                                4.)   type 'admin'
        -Admin(Type admin)                                                                                                                                                                                  5.)   type 'exit' 
        -Exit (Type exit)    

-admin access: username: 'Admin' password: 'password'
-The inital phase: Introduction display script defined by menu().
-Second phase: variable containing user input that is coericed as a string 
-Third Phase: Block of if statements which are passed by user input leading to: games,cart,buy,admin, and exit

---Project Requirements---
My project fulfills the requirements: -List of lists containing inventory details -While Master Loop with break kw -5 functions each called appropriately -import and use of datetime.datetime module and function -import and use of random

---Bugs---
There are a few loop bugs that I haven't yet figured out. Line 89 lines and 93. This bug is due to functioning of the 'for' statement. I haven't yet figured it out; but I will continue to expand on my python knwoledge till I have.

---Personal Statement---
Ive learned Python is a deep deep rabbit hole. It has been a blind dive learning this language especially as a new programmer. Admittedly I did struggle through out this course. Sometimes I found the lectures challenging to understand. I still have much to learn. Which is why I really appreciate being a student of Code Louisville. Thank you to all the mentors. Will Tirone really helped me out. I found myself in a pinch in the last week; being overwhelmed by the project I had in mind. I ultimately scraped it. Mr. Tirone suggested this kind of python project. Big life saver! Thank you all once again. Enjoy the holidays and finally the end of 2020. See you all next year in the SQL class.
