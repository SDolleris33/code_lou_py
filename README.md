This repo includes the entirety of my PYTHON project.
The project is a comprehensive inventory program; that allows input through various phases contained within a Master Loop. The loop is based on conditional 'if' statements that are passed by string values.



-The inital phase:
 	Introduction display script defined by menu().
-Second phase:
	variable containing user input that is coericed as a string
-Third Phase:
	Block of if statements which are passed by user input leading to:
			show_inv(): indexed and formatted
			cart(): formatted with list iterables and datetime module
			buy(): formatted and contains sequence functions
-Last phase:
			breaks while loop
			

(The complete and final script is pushed as final.py to avoid git diff comparisons)

My project fulfills the requirements:
-List of lists containing inventory details
-While Master Loop with break kw
- 4 functions each called appropriately
-import and use of datetime.datetime module and function
-import and use of random


Ive learned Python is a deep deep rabbit hole. It has been a blind dive learning this language especially as a new programmer.
Admittedly I did struggle through out this course. Sometimes I found the lecturing challenging to understand.  However, I really appreciate being a student of Code Louisville.
Thank you to all the mentors. Will Tirone did a real good job. I found myself in a pinch the last week; being overwhelmed by the project I had in mind, ultimately scraping it. Will suggested this kind of python project. Big life saver! Thank you all once again. Enjoy the holidays and finally the end of 2020. See you all next year in the SQL class.
